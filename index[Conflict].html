        <h3>Why are we here?</h3>
        <p>This is my first webpage written completely by hand. I've gotten this far so things must be going ok. Bravo for me. I plan on learning various coding languages so I decided to start a reference page to keep track of things and maybe document my journey a little as well.</p>
        <p>I am brushing up on some HTML, CSS, and learning Javascript at the moment but hope to learn this plus delve into Ruby on Rails and NodeJS, maybe some Angular to with it.  Hopefully this site will help me gather my thoughts and maybe help others as well.  Helping others is always good Karma.</p>

      <em><p title="Mayhem Tooltip">A few things about the mind behind the mayhem:</p></em>
    <ul>
      <li>My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I learned BASIC because it was all we had.  I mainly made inappropriate word based games, but it was so cool.</li>
      <li>My first flip phone was a Moto Razr. And before that I had <b>*gasp*</b> a pager.  It was cutting edge technology at the time. I still know how to use a payphone.</li>
      <li>I'm considered a Xennial.  Yeah, it's a thing now, look it up. I fall right on the cusp of the generational shift.  Exciting, I know. I was the first to use the new waves of technology which helped me gain my footing in the Technology industry.  I'm a total geek at heart.</li>
      <li>I'm diving into the world of Development and plan to use this as not only a Development outlet but also gather a list of reference material that will help others on their journey as well.  Learning while doing is the easiest way for me to digest new materials, so welcome.</li>
